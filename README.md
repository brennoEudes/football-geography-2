# Football Geography Game

## Project

This is my first Web Development project realized at IronHack Bootcamp - January/2023.

## The Game

The game is a Quiz that will test your knowledge about the geography of football teams that will play in the FIFA Club World Cup - February/2023, in which each team is the champion of his continent.
